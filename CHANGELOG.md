## 32.0.0

### üõ† Breaking changes

- deprecated `import { Font } from 'expo-font'` in favor of individually named exports (`import * as Font from expo-font`) for better dead-export elimination potential. Upgrade `@expo/vector-icons` if you get a warning about this. By [@ide](https://github.com/ide) ([`264c17cd`](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/264c17cdb175021c7fd16bb461652b8ab6cb2fda))
